# Stream Link Manager for Channels
In <b>[Channels DVR](https://getchannels.com/)</b>, users have the ability to add "<b>[Stream Links](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/stream-links/)</b>" as local content. These <b>Stream Links</b> appear as normal Movies, TV Shows, and Videos next to recorded and other content but do not play in the apps directly. Instead, clicking on one of these launches the appropriate app or web page and plays the content there. In order to do this, the process consists of creating ```.strmlnk``` files, putting them in the appropriate location, and running updates in the <b>Channels DVR</b> admin interface to get the programs to appear. As can be imagined, the creation and maintenance activity is incredibly manual and cumbersome.

Enter <b>Stream Link Manager for Channels</b>!

<b>Stream Link Manager for Channels</b> is a background service that sets up a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction. In the GUI, users can search for any Movie or TV Show and bookmark it. If it cannot be found, manual additions are allowed. Assuming a program is found, the software will parse through a user-derived list of Streaming Services (i.e., Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, Hoopla, Kanopy, etc...) in priority order to determine the appropriate link. After this, the necessary folders and files will be created, along with all other administrative tasks. Should a bookmark move from one Streaming Service to another, <b>Stream Link Manager for Channels</b> will automatically update everywhere that is required. But this is just the beginning of its capabilities! To learn more, watch the video here:
